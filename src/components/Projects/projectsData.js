    title: "IOT BASED SMART IRRIGATION WITH WEED DETECTION USING ML",
    description: "This project automates soil and crop management using sensors and AI. It analyzes soil moisture levels and controls irrigation automatically. With the YOLOv8 algorithm, it detects unwanted plants in the field through image recognition. The system also provides real-time weather updates to help farmers make better decisions for healthy crop growth.",

    title: "ANIMAL SPECIES DETECTION",
    description: "This project uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to identify animal species from images. By training a model on labeled animal images, it can accurately predict the species in new, unseen photos. Techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning are used to improve accuracy. This can help in wildlife monitoring, pest detection, and conservation efforts.",
